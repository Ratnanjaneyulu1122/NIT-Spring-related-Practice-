Transaction Management
----------------------
when any DML statements are executed, as a developer we need to make sure either COMMIT if all DML executions are good otherwise we need to ROLLBACK if there is failure in execution.
Steps to achieve Trnsaction Mangement
-------------------------------------
1) Define Trnsaction Manger bean in spring.xml
<bean id="transactionManager" class="org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DataSourceTransactionManager">
		<property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
	</bean>
2) Enable Transaction Mangement	by using
	<tx:annotation-driven />
3) Use @Transactional annotaion wherever you need it. Generally we use it  for DML operations
@Transactional(rollbackForClassName = {"java.lang.Exception"})
It means during the execution of query, if i get Exception , then Trnsaction Manager will ROLLBACK, otherwise it COMMIT
