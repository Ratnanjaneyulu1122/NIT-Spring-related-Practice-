Agenda:
	Revision
	I want to build spring ORM layer without using XML
		1) spring.xml 
		2) employee.hbm.xml --> Done
	To answer this, we need to use couple of annotations more.
	We used already the following annotations:
		@Transactional
		@Controller
		@RequestMapping
		@Autowired
		@Data
		@AllArgsConstructor
		@NoArgsConstructor
	
	New Annotations are :
	---------------------
	@Table --> To define table name. If you have class and table names are same, 
			   it is optional
	@Id --> To define as a primary key
	@GeneratedValue --> To define generator value, ex: IDENTITY, SEQUENCE, AUTO etc.,
	@Entity --> To define the class represents a database table
	@Column --> To define table column name. If you have class attrubute name and
				table column name are same, It is optional
	
	@Configuration --> To define the class as a spring configuration class
	Spring support that it can have more than one XML configurations
		Ex: for a multi module based application, we create a separate spring XML 
			for every module
	
	@Bean --> To define spring bean
	@EnableTransactionManagement --> To enable the transaction behaviour by spring
	@ComponentScan --> To provide basic package path to find spring beans.
