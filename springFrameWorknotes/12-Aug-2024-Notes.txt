	ModelAndView class is used to setup

		2) Model to be displayed on the View
	syntax:
		ModelAndView mv = new ModelAndView("view","key of Model","model");
		or
		ModelAndView mv = new ModelAndView();

	InternalResourceViewResolver
		It is used to add prefix and suffix for the given view name in the controller class.
		
	In the below code snippet:
	
	@RequestMapping("/showStudent")
	public String showStudent(Model model) {
