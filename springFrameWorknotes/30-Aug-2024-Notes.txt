Agenda:
	Revision
	Implement all CRUD operations in DAO class
	Dialect:
	--------
	The dialect specifies the type of database used in hibernate so that hibernate generate appropriate type of SQL statements.
	Hibernate provides different dialects based on type of database
	But in the current release, it is not required to mention because Hibernate is intelligent to pull the respective dialect based on database used.
	Ex:
		MySQLDialect
		OracleDialect
		DB2Dialect
		etc.,
	Generator:
    ---------
	A generator class is used to generate an ID for an object, which is going to be inserted in the database as a primary key. The ID is a unique identifier for the objects of the persistent class. 
	Hibernate provides a  <generator> tag to represent the generator.
	Hibernate provides list of generators for different databases
